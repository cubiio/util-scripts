# Utility Scripts

A collection of scripts to automate repeated and mundane tasks.

## Set-up

1. Git clone the repo.

2. Add the directory to path so all scripts can be called from any location.

```bash
# for zsh shell add to ~/.zshrc
export PATH=$PATH:~/{code-directory}/bash-util-scripts
```

3. Make the scripts executable

```bash
# make a script executable
chmod u+x ./{script_name.sh}
```
